abstract = {Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.},

abstract = {Aim Our scientific understanding of the extent and distribution
of mangrove forests of the world is inadequate. The available
global mangrove databases, compiled using disparate geospatial
data sources and national statistics, need to be improved. Here,
we mapped the status and distributions of global mangroves using
recently available Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat
archive. Methods We interpreted approximately 1000 Landsat scenes
using hybrid supervised and unsupervised digital image
classification techniques. Each image was normalized for
variation in solar angle and earth--sun distance by converting
the digital number values to the top-of-the-atmosphere
reflectance. Ground truth data and existing maps and databases
were used to select training samples and also for iterative
labelling. Results were validated using existing GIS data and the
published literature to map `true mangroves'. Results The total
area of mangroves in the year 2000 was 137,760 km2 in 118
countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions
of the world. Approximately 75{\%} of world's mangroves are found
in just 15 countries, and only 6.9{\%} are protected under the
existing protected areas network (IUCN I-IV). Our study confirms
earlier findings that the biogeographic distribution of mangroves
is generally confined to the tropical and subtropical regions and
the largest percentage of mangroves is found between 5° N and 5°
S latitude. Main conclusions We report that the remaining area of
mangrove forest in the world is less than previously thought. Our
estimate is 12.3{\%} smaller than the most recent estimate by the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. We
present the most comprehensive, globally consistent and highest
resolution (30 m) global mangrove database ever created. We
developed and used better mapping techniques and data sources and
mapped mangroves with better spatial and thematic details than
previous studies.},
